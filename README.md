Inspiration

We were inspired to take this route due to noticing the increase in crypto purchasing throughout the last two years, especially with the popularity of NFTs. Popular coins like Bitcoin that are used to make these purchases, require high levels of computer processing power which can be detrimental to our environment.

As two female crypto enthusiasts that understand the long-term affects of crypto-mining, we challenged ourselves to find an answer to "How Might we encourage people like us, to make environmentally conscious decisions within the crypto community?"

With crypto and crypto assets still in its infancy, identifying a solution now can save us years worth of damage to the Earth and lead us to a more environmentally conscious future.

Partnering with TreeCanada and One Tree Planted was also an important element we wanted to incorporate. 2021 in Canada has been one of the busiest fire seasons in recent years. According to Natural Resources Canada, there have been 6,224 fires to date nationally which is nearly double of last year. Empowering charities focused on rebuilding will also let people within the crypto community make positive contributions to our Earth while making environmentally conscious purchases.

What it does

The solution to our problem is called Grypto, a not-for-profit eco-friendly crypto wallet assistant that encourages users to purchase using environmentally-friendly coins. Each time a user purchases an environmentally friendly crypto coin, it is added to Grypto. Any purchases made using these coins would not only contribute to the growth of your forest within your dashboard but also enable TreeCanada in building a tree somewhere in Canada.

Grypto users would have to sync their crypto wallets to their Grypto accounts in order for updates to be noted in their account. Grypto will act as a crypto wallet assistant, notifying users of the list of tokens that are considered eco-friendly. Grypto will not serve as a crypto wallet.

Grypto will be updated in real-time and allow users to see the growth in their forest on their page giving them a visual interpretation of how they are creating positive impact to our Earth.

How we built it

Grypto's frontend is powered by React, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Api's Grypto communicates with in order to provide its data include, https://p.nomics.com/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-api. For Grypto's backend, Python was used.

Grypto features a dashboard to display Crypto coins, assets and forest. Grypto also includes a page strictly for a user's wallet and lists all cryptos the user holds. Grypto also eco-friendly validates purchases within the Make Purchases tab.

Challenges we ran into

In order for purchases to be made with Grypto's assistance, we would have to partner or synchronize the purchasing method of not only NFTs but any assets that can be purchased with eco-friendly crypto currencies. Since eco-friendly currencies are still in its infancy, identifying all assets that can be purchased with these coins was a challenge.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud to have identified a tangible solution to the environmental concerns surrounding crypto currencies. Grypto has become an idea that we are passionate about and can see being useful today and in the future.

What we learned

As crypto enthusiasts, we learned that the sky was the limit when it came to identifying ways to encourage more environmentally cautious decision making in the crypto community.

We also learned about the rise in forest fires within North America and also the rise in carbon emissions with crypto currencies.

What's next for Grypto

Grypto intends to synchronize with all crypto asset purchasing platforms like OpenSea to advocate the importance of environmental cautious purchasing. Grypto plans to expand alongside all eco-friendly currencies in order to emphasize and create positive impact on the environment.
